## Problem with K-Means
- Can fail sometimes on complex datasets
# DBSCAN
- **Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise**
- Based upon on the idea, that a cluster is a high density area surrounded by low density region
- Starts by exploring a small area, if density is "good enough" it considered as part of cluster, and explores neigbours and so on, so it groups regions based upon density!
